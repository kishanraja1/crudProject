# crudProject
This is my first full stack application:

Technologies Used:
1. Express (with jQuery/js)
2. Mongoose
3. BootStrap
4. Atlas for cloud database
5. Heroku for deploying


Approach Taken:
1. Set up class schedule with basic CRUD capabilities with express and Mongoose
2. Add bootstrap to style and add user interactivity
3. Add a 2nd collection for shopping items
4. Add a shopping cart feature
5. Add user login feature
6. Adjust permissions based on user admin status

Unsolved Problems:
1. Users can log in and choose whether they are an admin or not. However, the permissions are not working as expected.

User Story:
This project is intended to have 2 experiences: One for the gym owner/staff and one for gym members
-Gym Owner: Should have all CRUD capabilites for adjust gym class schedule and edit product offerings
-Members: Should have read capabilites on the schedule. They should also be able to visit the product offerings page and add items to their personalized cart

NOTES TO SELF:
